# SnaFoo

SnaFoo is an app which allows employees within a workplace to suggest and vote on snacks to be purchased and made available to staff for the following month. The Ruby on Rails app lets employees suggest a snack by either choosing from a list of previous suggestions or entering a snack and purchase location of their choosing. Each month, an employee can suggest one snack and vote for up to three snacks. The app is designed in such a way as to display the number of remaining votes at the top of the page.

### What additional features could be added in the future?

Test

### What approach would need to be taken to make the app available at different offices in different locations?

### How could security be improved within the app?

### What could be done to allow employees to use any device while keeping the rules intact for voting and suggestions?

### What approach could be taken to create a shopping list which always contained 10 items?

On a given date each month, the snacks purchased every month and the top vote-getters would be emailed to the office manager, or person in charge of purchasing the snacks. They could be sorted by purchase location for easier shopping.
